        Dawa Karpo is a cozy and vibrant restaurant established in 2022 in New Delhi. 
        Known for its warm hospitality and delicious Tibetan cuisine, it quickly became 
        a favorite among locals and tourists looking to experience authentic flavors from
        the Himalayas. The name "Dawa Karpo," meaning "White Moon" in Tibetan, reflects 
        peace, purity, and a deep cultural connection to Tibetan heritage.

        The restaurant was founded by a young Tibetan entrepreneur with a passion for food 
        and community. Starting with a small shop, he dreamed of sharing his roots through 
        traditional dishes like momos, thukpa, shabalay, and butter tea. With dedication 
        and hard work, he transformed his humble beginnings into a full-fledged eatery 
        that blends modern style with Tibetan soul.

        Tibetan art and prayer flags, creating a calm and inviting space. Customers 
        appreciate the fresh ingredients, homemade recipes, and friendly service that 
        make each visit memorable. It serves as a cultural hub where people can connect 
        over warm meals and a shared appreciation for Tibetan traditions.

        Today, Dawa Karpo continues to grow, symbolizing the spirit of resilience and 
        entrepreneurship in the Tibetan community. It stands as a proud reminder that 
        even a small dream, when rooted in culture and passion, can flourish in the 
        heart of a bustling city like Delhi.
